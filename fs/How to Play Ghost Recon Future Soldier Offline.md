This is a difficulty level that makes the enemies more aggressive and accurate, reduces your health regeneration, disables your crosshair and mini-map, and limits your ammo supply. To access this mode, select Elite from the difficulty options when starting a new campaign.[^3^]
- If you want to unlock more weapons and attachments offline, you can use the Gunsmith Mode. This is a mode that allows you to customize your weapons with various parts and test them in a firing range. You can unlock new parts by completing challenges in the campaign or guerrilla mode. To access this mode, select Gunsmith from the main menu.[^4^]
